Baby, you call in the dead of night
But you don't need me like I need you
Pray that I won't be alone
Baby, you call in the dead of night
But you don't need me like I need you
Pray that I won't be alone, yeah
Yeah, hey, what
Trapped in my mind
Lost in the sky
Stuck on the side
I need you in my life
Drinking this wine
I don't wanna fight
Thought you were mine
But we done for this ride
Now this bed feels so empty without you
Baby, you the only girl who I'm drawn to
What used to be warmth turned to cold blue
I tried to stay, but I guess you never came through, uh
I've been feeling too much pain tonight
But I can't change the way you feel
So tonight I'll cry alone
Baby, you call in the dead of night
But you don't need me like I need you
Pray that I won't be alone
Baby, you call in the dead of night
But you don't need me like I need you
Pray that I won't be alone
